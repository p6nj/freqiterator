# FreqIterator
A frequency generator and a scale generator as iterators.

Each generator is very modular and both combined can make scales in any mode and variable TET. Perfect for uses where you need a lot of frequencies and can't be bothered to calculate everything yourself. Just start a generator, skip some items and you have it.
